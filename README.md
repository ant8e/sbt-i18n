Sbt i18n is a very simple internationalization tools, that reads resources bundles files in properties files, json, or 
[HOCON](https://github.com/lightbend/config#using-hocon-the-json-superset) format and generate Scala code. Strings in 
[ICU](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/format_parse/messages/) format are supported.

A configuration file like this

```hocon
en = {
  key1 = a text
  key2 ="a parametrized text {0}"
  subsection {
    key3 = some text
  }
  plural = "{dogsCount, plural, one {One dog is} other {# dogs are}}"
}

```

will generate the following Scala code 

```scala
import com.ibm.icu.text.MessageFormat

import java.util.Locale

object Bundle {
  val languages: Map[String, I18N] = Map(("en", en))

  abstract class I18N {
    protected val locale: Locale
    
    def key1: String
    def key2(x0: String): String
    
    abstract class Subsection {
      def key4: String
    }
    
    def subsection: Subsection

    def plural(dogsCount: Long): String
  }

  object en extends I18N {
    override protected val locale: Locale = Locale.forLanguageTag("en")

    val key1 = """a text"""
    def key2(x0: String): String = new MessageFormat("""a parametrized text {0}""", locale)
      .format(java.util.Map.of("0", x0))
   
    object subsection  extends Subsection {
       val key4= """2"""
    }

    def plural(dogsCount: Long): String = new MessageFormat(
      """{dogsCount, plural, one {One dog is} other {# dogs are}}""", 
      locale
    ).format(java.util.Map.of("dogsCount", dogsCount))
}
}
     
```

The motivation here is to depart from the traditional way of doing "stringly typed" message fetching and to have a 
stronger coupling between the application code and the message translations. Having your build break when a 
translation is missing or on a faulty pattern is something you may want.   


## Usage

This plugin requires sbt 1.0.0+. ICU support is implemented using 
[icu4j](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/icu4j/) library. 

Add the following to `project/plugins.sbt:`

    addSbtPlugin("tech.ant8e" % "sbt-i18n" % "0.7")

Write a config file in `src/main/i18n/xxx.conf`.

```hocon
en = {
  msg1 = a text
  msg2 ="a parametrized text {0}"
}

fr = {
  msg1 = un texte
  msg2 ="un texte paramétré {0}"
}

``` 

And access your translations in your Scala code

```scala
val msg1 = org.example.i18n.Bundle.en.msg1
val msg2 = org.example.i18n.Bundle.en.msg2("hello")
```

The scala Bundle will be generated by default in package `org.example.i18n` this can of course be configured: 

In oder to change the output package set `i18nBundlePackageName := "org.myorganisation.i18n"` in `build.sbt`. 
  
## Input files

the plugin will parse all files within `src/main/i18n` with the [Typesafe config](https://github.com/lightbend/config) 
library and build one single config hierarchy that will be the source of the code generation. The top level keys are
assumed to be language selectors.   

###  Caveats 

The plugin will merge multiple files will no guarantee about order or conflict resolution. When two or more files defines 
the exact same configuration path it is undefined who will "win".       

## Scala Code

### Overview 
The plugin will generate one scala object named `Bundle` in the specified package.

This object contains one abstract class named `I18N` that defines the structure of each language.

For each language (or top level key), an object, named like the key, implementing the `I18N` class is generated.

Simple message will appear as `val` and parametrized messages as methods. 
 
## Parametrized messages 
 
A message that is a valid *java.text.MessageFormat* pattern will be generated as a method. 
See [MessageFormat](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/MessageFormat.html)
documentation for details about the supported patterns. 

ICU *MessageFormat* extends *java.text.MessageFormat* in a backward compatible way by adding three more 
placeholder types:

* plural
* select
* selectordinal

Apart from new placeholder types ICU also adds named parameters to all supported placeholders

```hocon
en = {
  msg1 = "{0, date, long}"
  msg2 = "{birtDate, date, long}"
}
```

During generation the plugin will infer the correct argument type from the pattern. 
`number` will have type `Double` by default and `Long` when the `integer` format style is selected. 
Date and time will have type `java.time.ZonedDateTime`. `choice` being a number format will lead to a `Double`. 
`plural` and `selectordinal` will have type `Long`. For the `select` a new ADT will be generated and used.
By default (when no format is specified), the argument will be of type `String`.

## Missing keys

The structure of a bundle is a merge of all the keys of all the languages. Should a key not be defined in a specific 
language, it will be generated as `??? [key] ???`.
      
In oder to break generation on missing key set `i18nBreakOnMissingKeys := true` in `build.sbt`. 

Alternatively, you can set `i18nOptionalReturnValues` to `true` in `build.sbt` to generate `Option` return types 
for the key values.

Above options are mutually exclusive.
